UX Philosophy

Clicktory mWeb should feel like a mobile app, not a compressed website.

Principles:

Familiar patterns

Minimal cognitive load

Strong hierarchy

Calm, confident visuals

Navigation UX
Bottom App Navigation

Primary navigation surface

Thumb-first design

Always visible

Predictable behavior

Why 4 Tabs

Cognitive sweet spot

No hidden destinations

Matches user mental model

Profile UX (Core Decision)

Profile is a hub, not a page.

Why a Bottom Sheet

Keeps user in context

Faster than route navigation

Familiar from modern apps

Reduces bounce

Visual Hierarchy

Account actions first

Platform/meta second

Clear divider between sections

Footer UX (mWeb)

Footer is removed, not minimized.

Reason:

Footers are a desktop construct

On mobile, they signal “I’m done”

Important actions should never live there
