ANTI-GRAVITY MASTER PROMPT

Goal: Make Clicktory mWeb look and feel like a native app

CONTEXT

We are redesigning Clicktory mobile web (mWeb) to feel like a modern mobile app, not a responsive website.

Current problems:

Footer requires excessive scrolling

Navigation feels web-like, not app-like

Visual system is flat and desktop-oriented

Important actions are buried

This redesign is mobile-first, app-inspired, and production-ready.

CORE OBJECTIVE

Transform mWeb into an App-Like Experience with:

Bottom app navigation

Profile hub instead of footer

Modern typography

Subtle gradients

Strong visual hierarchy

Zero clutter

NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES

Mobile-first only (desktop untouched)

App-like navigation patterns

No desktop footer on mWeb

No infinite scrolling dependency

Clean, calm, premium look

Subtle gradients, not loud colors

High readability, low noise

NAVIGATION SYSTEM (PRIMARY)
Bottom App Navigation (Fixed)

Always visible on mWeb.

Exactly 4 tabs only:

Home

Search

Dashboard

Profile

Rules:

Icon + label (labels mandatory)

Active tab visually distinct

Height: 56–64px

Safe-area aware (iOS / Android)

No shadows, only subtle top border

PROFILE TAB BEHAVIOR (CRITICAL)

Clicking Profile opens a full-height bottom sheet, not a new page.

Profile Sheet Structure
SECTION 1: ACCOUNT (Top Priority)

Darkened / elevated visual weight

Public Profile

Share Profile

My Products

Saved

Settings

Logout

SECTION DIVIDER

Clear visual separation (spacing + divider)

SECTION 2: PLATFORM / META (Old Footer Content)

Lower visual weight

Plans (Pricing)

Blog

About Clicktory (About + Mission merged)

Newsletter

Social icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter)

Rules:

Single scroll container

Swipe-down to dismiss

Rounded top corners

No nested scrolling

No brand paragraph text

FOOTER STRATEGY (IMPORTANT)

Desktop footer remains unchanged

mWeb footer is disabled

All footer intent is moved into Profile sheet

COLOR SYSTEM (MODERNIZATION)

TYPOGRAPHY (STRICT)

DELIVERABLE EXPECTATION FROM ANTI-GRAVITY

No experimental gimmicks

TONE & VIBE
